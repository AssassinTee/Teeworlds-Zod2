# Teeworlds-Zod2
## Description
Zod is a Zombie-Mod for the retro-multiplayergame [Teeworlds](www.teeworlds.com).
It if written for teeworlds 0.7 and supports 60 zombies and 4 players.
The Mod supports a big variance of zombie-types.

After (re-)starting the game the mod beginns sending the first wave. After the player has defeated the first wave, a warmup starts and the next wave beginns.
The waves get more difficult the more you progress, because more zombie-types are added to the waves.

If you die, the **team** loses one if its lifes.

The game is over, after all teamlifes are gone.
